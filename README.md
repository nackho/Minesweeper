# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is 1-player game where the player is given a board that has hidden mines. The player is to click a square on the board to reveal what is underneath. Safe squares are either empty, or have a number telling you how many mines are directly adjacent to that square. Using the numbers is the key to success. In addition, if a player so chooses, there is a flag button available. When the flag button is pressed, the players click places flags on mines they believe are safe. A player wins when they flag all the mines and unveil all other tiles, or if they reveal around all the mines.
